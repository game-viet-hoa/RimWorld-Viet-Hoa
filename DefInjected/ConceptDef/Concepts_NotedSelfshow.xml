  <ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>One of the most important parts of RimWorld is choosing good work settings for your colonists.\n\nPoor work settings can leave essential work unfinished for a long time while colonists waste time on unimportant tasks.\n\nTo give more control over what work colonists do, you can use the Manual Priorities mode in the WORK tab.\n\nIn this mode, each colonist has a priority number for each work type. Colonists will do priority 1 work from left to right, then priority 2 work from left to right, and so on.\n\nIntelligent use of these setting is essential for a large, well-automated colony.</ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>

  <FirePreparation.label>Fire preparation</FirePreparation.label>
  <FirePreparation.helpText>Fires can easily burn down a colony. To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.</FirePreparation.helpText>
